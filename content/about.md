Also, this website collects analytics. The analytics server is hosted on a VPS we rent from Vultr. It's just used so that we can see what people are reading. The data will not be used to make money, but we might publish anonymized statistics here and otherwise freely share some aspects of the data.

If you don't want to be tracked, enable the "Do Not Track" setting in your web browser.
